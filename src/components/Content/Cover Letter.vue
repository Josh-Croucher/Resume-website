                My name is Josh, I am 18 years old and in my first year of a Bachelor/Masters of Mechatronic Engineering at UQ. I enjoy programming and first started when I was about 13, making small games in the Unity Game Engine. I then began learning web development in 2019, and have been learning and developing my skills since.

                I would love the chance to be a part of a company that will have a positive impact on so many people learning computer science. I remember when I first started learning HTML finding consistent resources was near impossible, leaving me with mountains are documentation to try learn from. It was only when I stumbled upon an online book that I haven’t been able to find since that I was able to fully grasp topics. Being able to contribute to a website that does that for so many different languages, even offering users an environment to experiment and play around would be amazing.

                I believe I would benefit the team by offering new ideas and an eagerness to learn and experiment, alongside a passion for making computer science for accessible to everyone. Conversely, I would love to be on the team as it offers me an opportunity to develop my skills in a professional context and turn my passion into a career.
